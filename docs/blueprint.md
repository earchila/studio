# **App Name**: LegalMind Contract Analyzer

## Core Features:

- Document Parsing: OCR processing to extract text from contract documents using an AI tool to assess layout for improved accuracy. It also attempts to determine the fields that may be present in the document for semantic parsing.
- Data Extraction: AI-powered extraction of key data points (dates, amounts, conditions, parties, addresses, contacts, etc.) from the parsed contract text, including penalties, non-compliance, etc. It also determines when it is able to fully extract the data to guarantee a minimum data quality.
- Breach Detection: Breach Condition Detection: Use an AI tool to analyze extracted data against predefined rules and conditions to identify potential breaches or non-compliance.
- Penalty Calculation: Penalty Amount Calculation: Automatically calculate penalty amounts based on the identified breaches, according to contract terms.
- Alert Dashboard: Alert Dashboard: Display identified breaches, penalty amounts, and relevant contract information in a clear, actionable dashboard.
- Alerting System: Define rules and conditions based on extracted data (e.g., contract expiration date, payment deadlines). System generates alerts when conditions are met.
- Document Upload: Document Upload: Allow users to upload contract documents in common formats (e.g., PDF, DOCX).
- Data Export: Permit the user to generate a CSV export containing all information about the contract
